                In this blog, I will talk about phase 1 JavaScript that I am
                currently studying at Academy-XI.
              </p>

              <p>
                JavaScript is proving to be somewhat difficult for me to grasp
                compared to html and css, even though some say it is quite easy
                to learn. Having used and still use a lot of logic calculations
                and formulas in excel and tableau etc., I thought js would be
                relatively easy for me however I am finding it isn't. Having the
                ability to problem solve and create work arounds is imperative
                in the industry I work in and js seems like it would be a good
                fit so to speak.
              </p>

              <p>
                To try and assist myself in learning js I have also searched the
                web for different ways to learn js but have still come up with
                very little in the way of simplified learning for this type of
                language. So, I have also looked into the way I am learning and
                studying and have found the following:
              </p>

              <p>
                - Dwelling/digging into problems too much. Diving whead first
                into rabbit holes is my specialty and sometimes I don't realise
                I'm doing it.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Studying for too long at one time with no break. As I live
                alone there is no one to remind me to take a break and I end up
                burning myself out a little.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Trying to figure out problems on my own. I tend to want to
                figure out issues by myself instead of utilising the forums to
                ask questions and read what others have done and gone through.
              </p>

              <p>
                To counteract all of the above I have had to set days and times
                in my calendar to ensure I take breaks and to set aside days for
                relaxation and spending time with my family. Juggling working
                full time and studying software engineering is tricky to say the
                least and does have an impact on those who are close to me due
                to the fact that I don't spend as muhch time with them and also
                looking quite tired most days.
              </p>

              <p>
                Reading the above it all starts to sound a little depressing so
                I want to assure anyone reading this blog that's not the case.
                This is something I really enjoy doing and want to succeed in so
                I am not giving up, merely just explaining my JavaScript journey
                thus far.
